# KingdomWars

KingdomWars is a Minecraft team minigame where you fight to capture the enemy team base. You can play as one of the 5 available classes, each with a unique and special role. To win, capture the enemy control points 3 times before them.


**Classes**

In KingdomWars you can play as one of the following 5 classes.

**Attacker:**
Attackers are high damage fast characters with a grenade for great point-clear and a decent set of armor. Their kit consists of:
A high damage melee weapon.
A (or multiple) grenade(s).
A set of iron armor.
**Defender:**
Defenders are tanky slow characters with a bow for long-range defenses. Their kit consists of:
A medium damage melee weapon.
A bow and arrow(s).
A set of enchanted iron or non-enchanted diamond armor.
**Skirmisher:**
Skirmishers are extremely fast moving offensive characters. They're extremely effective against buildings and have a grenade for point-clear/zoning. Their kit consists of:
A low damage melee weapon.
An anti-building weapon (eg. EMP-grenade, AT-weapon).
A set of chainmail or iron armor with speed boots.
**Builder:**
Builders are low damage defensive characters. Their damage doesn't come from themselves but from their buildings. A builder is able to build one building, a turret. There are 3 different types of turrets, all with unique effects.
A low damage melee weapon.
A placeable turret.
A set of iron armor.
**Support:**
Supports are low damage mobile supportive characters. They usually have healing/shielding items/buildings. Their kit consists of:
A low damage melee weapon.
A healing/shielding items/building.
A full set of iron armor with speed boots.

By playing a class you gain experience for that class. When you level up a class, new kits for that class will unlock. All kits are equally balanced, so higher level kits aren't better than the default kits. At certain levels you can also unlock cosmetics (eg. trails, hats) to look even cooler while playing your games. Classes can not be leveled up by donating or paying in any way.

**Control points**

Control points are square areas, outlined by blue or red particles. The blue point is yours, the red one from your enemy. Capturing an enemy point can be done by standing in it. While standing on it, a progress bar will display, indicating the capture progress. To capture a point, there need to be more teammates than enemies on the point. When nobody is on the point, the capture progress will quickly go down. After capturing a point, both teams get teleported back to their spawn.

**Buildings**

Buildings (previously known as deployables) are placeable structures offering usefully utility for the team. There are 3 types of buildings:
Turrets are defensive area-denial buildings, that will shoot enemies. There are different turrets available for different ranges.
Healing stations are supportive buildings that can heal teammates. There are a few different types available (eg. AOE heal, single target, etc.).
Shields are supportive wall-like structures that can provide great cover to teammates. There are different shapes and sizes of shields available.
After being placed, a building slowly constructs itself, and has 50% reduced health while constructing.
To kill a building, simply hit it like you would hit a uuid. Buildings can also be disabled (disabled is not destroyed) for a certain amount of time if they get hit by an EMP-grenade.

**Grenades**

Grenades are throwable explosives, looking like snowballs. They leave a smoke trail behind when thrown, and can be clearly seen when on the ground because of the smoke rising up. After a certain amount of time (depending on the grenade type) the grenade will explode and deal damage to anyone in range. There are many different grenades available, all with different and unique effects. After a grenade is thrown, it will take a certain amount of time (depending on the grenade type) before the thrower gets a new grenade. 


We hope you like the minigame, and we would love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Please send a DM to @Koenn if you want to help playtest, we're still looking for more people.
KingdomWars will be released soon, and we're hoping to see you when it does!
