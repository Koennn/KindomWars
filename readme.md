**Kingdom Wars**


In Kingdom Wars there are 2 teams. Both teams have a color, Red vs Blue. Each one has a base with a control point which they have to defend. Both teams need to try and capture the enemy objective, but also defend their own objective. To capture an objective you need to stand on it with more people than the enemy. There are a few classes you can play as:

`---> builders, given blocks to rebuild the base. Builders are supposed to keep the base intact and defend the objective from attackers.`

`---> skirmishers, given TNT to blow the opposite castle's walls and attack. Skirmishers are supposed to rush to the enemy base and try to blow up as many defenses as they can. They are very weak in combat, so they need to play careful and sneaky.`

`---> defenders, given diamond gear to defend from the enemy skirmishers. Defenders are supposed to track down skirmishers and stop them from blowing up the defenses. Defenders have powerful weapons, but often wear heavy armor, which makes them slow targets.`

`---> attackers, given decent armor and some powerful offensive weapons. Attackers are supposed to go to the enemy base after the walls and defenses are blown up. Their main job is capturing objectives and killing the enemy leader.`

`---> 1 leader, given special armor and a good amount of gear. And a lightning staff with a cooldown of 5 sec. The leader is supposed to lead the team. A leader can mark a player/area to command their team to focus it. They can use their lightning staff both as an offensive or defensive weapon.`
